# Computer Vision

This repo contains two projects:

- Cone Detection: to be used in Formula SAE Driverless
- Traffic Footage Tracker: to be used in smart cities cameras

- There is a paper-like PDF document for the cone detection project.


* Disclaimer: there are a few adjustments needed to be made with the video inputs to be able to run the notebooks correctly.
